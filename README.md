# Food-Price-ETL
Extract, Transform, Load of Food Prices

Project Proposal: 

We will **extract** 2 CSV files from Kaggle [historical data on avocado prices]https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/avocado-augmented and [2018 US grocery data]https://www.kaggle.com/agatii/total-sale-2018-yearly-data-of-grocery-shop. We will then **transform** the data by cleaning the avocado data to include only relevant time frame comparisons and filter the 2018 grocery prices for relevant comparisons to avocados. We will treat the price per a certain unit (ie: 10 oz) as a primary key in order to **load** the data into a relational database.
